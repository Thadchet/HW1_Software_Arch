# HW1_Software_Arch (RESTApi with Swagger)
## Things to be delivered:
1. Screenshots of Swagger for your APIs in 2. 
2. Source codes of 2 and 3.
3. Compare how to call the methods based on gRPC and REST API side-by-side, e.g. in a Table format as shown below.

| Function     | gRPC         | REST API   |
| ---          |     ---      |     ---    |
| List book    | xxx   | xxx |
| Insert book  | xxx     | xxx   |
| Delete book  | xxx     | xxx   |
| Watch book   | xxx     | xxx   |

4. What are the main differences between REST API and gRPC?
5. What is the benefits of introduceinterface in front of the gRPC and REST API of the book services.
6. Based on the introduced interface, compare how to call the methods based on gRPC and REST API side-by-side, e.g. in a
Table format as shown below. 

| Function     | gRPC         | REST API   |
| ---          |     ---      |     ---    |
| List book    | xxx   | xxx |
| Insert book  | xxx     | xxx   |
| Delete book  | xxx     | xxx   |
| Watch book   | xxx     | xxx   |

7. Draw a component diagram representing the book services with and without interfaces.
